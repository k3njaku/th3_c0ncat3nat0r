# th3 c0ncat3nat0r

A small Streamlit application that merges multiple media files into a single output:

- **Documents** (images, PDFs, plain text) → one combined PDF
- **Audio files** → one concatenated MP3
- **Video files** → one concatenated MP4

## Local development

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```

## Streamlit Community Cloud

Deploy this repository directly on [Streamlit Community Cloud](https://share.streamlit.io/) and the app will allow users to upload files and download the merged result.
